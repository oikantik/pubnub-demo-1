### Message History
Access previous messages to provide chat history when users join a conversation.

### Reliability
PubNub guarantees message delivery with automatic reconnection and catchup mechanisms.

## Implementation Overview

A typical chat application using PubNub includes these components:

1. **Backend Server**
   - Manages user authentication
   - Generates and distributes PubNub access tokens
   - Stores messages in a database (optional)

2. **Frontend Client**
   - Connects to PubNub using the appropriate SDK
   - Subscribes to relevant channels
   - Publishes messages to channels
   - Displays real-time updates (new messages, typing indicators, presence changes)

## Getting Started

1. Create a [PubNub account](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup)
2. Create a new application and keyset
3. Enable the features you need:
   - Presence
   - Storage & Playback
   - Access Manager
4. Use the provided documentation to implement your chat features

## Environment Variables

Your application should use the following environment variables for PubNub configuration:

```
PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=sub-c-your-subscribe-key
PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY=pub-c-your-publish-key
PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY=sec-c-your-secret-key
```

Remember that the secret key should only be used on your server and never exposed to clients.
